"""A text fed into a running turn is TAKEN when the CLI records its queue removal as absorbed_mid_turn, even with no
queued_command attachment; a removal for any other reason releases the hold but is never a delivery.

What happened (2026-10-09): romp feeds a running session one queued text at a time and holds the rest until it sees
the CLI take the current one (SdkSession._untaken, released by _untaken_taken). For a text fed mid-turn the take was
read only from the queued_command attachment the CLI writes when it splices the text into the turn. On one CLI
version some mid-turn takes left only the CLI's queue bookkeeping record, a queue-operation remove with reason
absorbed_mid_turn, and no attachment, so the hold never saw the take: busy sessions whose turns never end kept every
later text queued for over an hour.

The CLI writes a queue record's text only for a string-valued item: the enqueue of a text romp feeds carries the text,
its remove carries none. So the fix reads the removal by queue ORDER from a per-session ledger of the CLI's queue
records (sdk_backend._queue_ledger_fold: content-less removes resolve the oldest pending item that is not a CLI notice,
whose own removals keep their text), and by text where the removal names it (_queue_removal, through _text_take):
  * the previous text's late removal resolves the previous text, never the one now held, and a CLI notice queued ahead
    of the fed text does not take its content-less removal;
  * an absorbed_mid_turn removal naming the fed text is a take: the hold releases, the next text feeds into the same
    turn, the echoes it speaks for land by id (no record carries their text for the by-text retire), and it is
    counted (feed_take_counts);
  * a joined text (peer mail and tagged sends fed as one) matches its removal the same way, and every part's echo
    lands;
  * a removal for another reason releases the hold, since the text left the CLI's queue, and is never a delivery. A
    dropped_by_hook removal is not always a hook's decision: the CLI writes the same removal when its 540 s hook limit
    runs out or the session host reconnects before the kernel answers (2026-10-09: 78 drops in a day, 9 of 16 traced
    texts never came back). So a dropped_by_hook text romp's own prompt gate did not block goes back to the head of the
    queue and is fed again, at most three times per item (the fourth drop falls back), and never once its record
    landed; a text the gate blocked, or one whose re-sends are spent, is reported as removed unread: its echo is flagged
    never delivered (dropped and refused, like the prompt gate's refusal), it is not re-fed, its mail gets no read
    stamp, and one problem line names the session;
  * a remove with no reason (an older CLI's discard) or for another text releases nothing;
  * the queued_command attachment still releases the hold as before, and the boot re-delivery guard (_text_landed)
    reads an absorbed removal as a landing, so a restart cannot re-feed a text the turn already read.
