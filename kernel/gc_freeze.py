"""Road B for issue #1735: keep the loaded decoded heap out of the cycle collector's walk.

A generation-two (full) collection visits every tracked container in the interpreter; the
request-serving kernel holds millions of them in decoded transcript trees, so a warm full
collection pauses every thread (the pusher included) for seconds. `gc.freeze()` moves the
currently tracked objects into a permanent generation the collector never walks again, so a
later full collection walks only what was allocated since. Measured (plans/gc-full-collection-pause.md):
a warm full collection over 5.6 million loaded objects fell from 2.83 s to 0.1 ms once they were
frozen, and the freeze itself is a pointer move.

Two operations, both at the pusher's IDLE boundary (never a timer), where a pause is paid with no
browser waiting:

  - a LOAD fold-in (cheap): `gc.collect(); gc.freeze()`. The collect walks only the unfrozen objects
    loaded since the last freeze, so it costs milliseconds; the freeze folds their survivors in.
    Keyed on the record cache's insert counter growing by a material number of trees.
  - a RELEASE reclaim (up to the full pause), STAGED: `gc.collect()` with the freeze IN PLACE first (cheap,
    it takes a released cycle allocated since the last freeze), then the owed refs are re-read and only a
    survivor drives `gc.unfreeze(); gc.collect()` (the frozen-heap walk); a `gc.freeze()` re-holds either
    way. A release the cheap walk took whole counts as a LOAD pass, so the backstop's bound does not stretch.

WHEN to reclaim is MEASURED, not guessed. Three review rounds each guessed cyclicity from a state flag
(a session's `client`, its thread) and each found a new path the guess missed (a teardown exception
after the client was cleared leaves a cyclic session with client None). So instead of deciding at the
pop, every session-end pop REGISTERS a `weakref.ref(session)` (with its worker thread) via `note_ended`,
and the idle tick judges each by observation: a dead ref died by reference counting (acyclic, no
reclaim); a live ref whose worker thread still runs is not garbage yet (kept for the next tick, a kill
mid-turn); a live ref whose thread has finished is a cycle the collector must take (reclaim once for all
such, then drop them). Exact on every path, no per-path reasoning. A BOUNDED BACKSTOP (after
`backstop_foldins` load fold-ins) covers any ended owner nobody registered. The record cache's
`released` counter is a /perf statistic, never a trigger: its entries are acyclic.

The thread test rests on CPython's own threading: a running session and its worker Thread reference each
other (the Thread holds the session as its `_target`), and `Thread.run` deletes `_target` in a `finally`
when it returns, so once the thread has finished it no longer holds the session. A live ref whose thread
has finished is therefore held by a DIFFERENT surviving cycle (a traceback frame, a stray reference), the
reclaim's target. An UNSTARTED thread reads as finished (`is_alive()` False) and still holds the session
(the Thread keeps `_target`, since `run`'s finally never fires for it), so the ref is alive on a cycle;
judging it a reclaim is correct precisely because ONLY the collector can take that cycle (refcounting never
will), which is what a reclaim does. A ref a live ROOT keeps (a helper thread still running when the tick
judges it, its frame and its target, not a cycle) reads the same, alive with a finished worker, and is TREATED
as a surviving cycle: the reclaim frees nothing, so it costs ONE reclaim, is counted a `survivor` on /perf,
and is dropped (never re-registered), never a pass per tick.

A request that arrives during a reconcile waits that one collection; the idle boundary is the best
moment for it, not a guarantee none arrives. Default on; `ROMP_GC_FREEZE=off` (or `0`/`false`) off.

A third operation, the FULL-COLLECTION freeze (2026-10-07): the load fold-in keys on the record cache's inserts, and
once the cache's decoded records were untracked (they never enter the walk at all) the heap that grows OUTSIDE the cache
(about 16 GB tracked on the live kernel) was frozen only by the start-up freeze, so every organic full collection walked
it: about 67 an hour averaging 5.9 s, longest 17.8 s, 11% of wall time. So the controller also hooks gc.callbacks and, on
the "stop" of an ORGANIC generation-2 collection whose pause reached `full_freeze_ms`, calls gc.freeze() right there. At
that instant every tracked object has just survived a full collection (the collector merged the young generations into
the old and freed the unreachable), so the freeze pins no garbage; it is a pointer move, so it costs no pause, and the
next full collection walks only what was promoted since. The pause threshold keys the freeze on the event that costs
(an expensive walk) and leaves cheap full collections alone (the bench froze about once every 10 to 40 s while the cheap
walks averaged about 250 ms; scripts/bench_gc_full_rate.py). What a freeze CAN pin is a cycle that
forms LATER among objects it froze (alive at the freeze, cyclic garbage afterwards): those are not walked until an
unfreeze, so once a full-collection freeze has run, a backstop reclaim (the same unfreeze/collect/re-freeze the fold-in
backstop runs) is owed at the next idle tick when the organic full-collection pause summed since the last reclaim reaches
`full_backstop_ratio` times the largest pause seen (the last reclaim's walk or an organic one, about the whole heap): its
cost is bounded by what the collector already spends, keyed on measured pauses, never a clock. While a backstop is owed
and has not run, the callback freezes NOTHING more (each skip counted), so what is pinned cannot grow; and because the
idle tick may never come under sustained load (the live kernel once read no idle pusher cycle in 5.5 hours), an owed
backstop that has waited `full_force_s` (ROMP_GC_FREEZE_FULL_FORCE_S, default 600 s) runs at the next BUSY pusher cycle
boundary instead (pusher_tick, never inside the gc callback or a locked region), counted as forced. The idle tick stays
the preferred path. The rule is ONE for both backstops: the fold-in backstop (after `backstop_foldins` load fold-ins) and
the full backstop share the owed test (`_backstop_owed`), one owed-since clock and one forced run (the live kernel once
read 4 idle pusher cycles in 91, so the fold-in backstop could wait as long as the full one). The forced path is governed by
ROMP_GC_FREEZE_FULL_FORCE_S alone, so it also covers the fold-in backstop with ROMP_GC_FREEZE_FULL_MS off. The third collection
threshold is raised to `full_t2` with the freeze: once the long-lived heap is frozen, a full collection is cheap but
CPython's quarter rule no longer holds it back (the long-lived total it divides is the small unfrozen part), so the
generation-1 count gate is what bounds the rate. `ROMP_GC_FREEZE_FULL_MS=off` (or 0) restores the
behaviour before this operation; `ROMP_GC_FREEZE=off` turns every operation off.
